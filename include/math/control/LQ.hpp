 * \brief   Templated implementation of Linear Quadratic Control
 *
 * The file contains two related implementations of the Linear Quadratic Regulator.
 * The standard LQ implementation is a straight-forward implementation
 * of the LQ controller which is fed with a linear model providing the
 * nescessary matrices: state description A, control signal description B,
 * control selecting matrix M, state cost regulation matrix Q and
 * control signal regulation matrix R.
 *
 * The second implementation, named Dynamic LQ (DLQ), does the same thing
 * as the static LQ, with the exception that the model is re-linearized
 * each iteration. This can be used for non-linear cases when computations
 * are cheap.
 *
 * Both classes are, after setup, interfaced with a commonly named function
 * \em control_signal , which can be called with or without a reference to follow.
